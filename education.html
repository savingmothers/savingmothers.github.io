          <h3>Lifestyle Modification</h3>
<p>Women with high body weights often encounter medical complications during pregnancy, including diabetes and high blood pressure. On average, they require more cesarean sections, and experience higher rates of birth defects and infertility. Our goal is to empower these women to develop nutrition and exercise habits that can ensure safer deliveries for both themselves and their newborns. 
 [Button to expand that says: Toolkit].</p>
 
</p>Saving Mothers offers a custom toolkit of information and materials to help clinics, community centers and health providers implement similar programs for women in their areas. In addition to the toolkit, Saving Mothers representatives also serve as a resource for newly-founded programs and providers looking to start lifestyle modification programs at their own health care facilities. If you are interested in establishing a program like this near you, please click here [add a button to portal]</p>
